      "body": "## Summary\n\nThis PR includes several clarifications and improvements to the constellation code specification:\n\n- **Circular orbits restriction**: Added paragraph in introduction explaining circular orbit restriction and mentioning Molniya/Flower constellations as future scope\n- **Inclination ranges**: Clarified that typical inclination ranges for Walker Star (~90\u00b0) and Walker Delta (45-65\u00b0) are not geometric constraints\n- **Walker Star cross-plane links**: Rewrote to explain seam effect limits cross-plane links but doesn't prevent them (citing Iridium as example), noted Delta is preferred for OISL\n- **Retrograde orbits**: Changed inclination range from [0, 90] to [0, 180] with explanation that >90\u00b0 represents retrograde orbits\n- **Mean anomaly**: Clarified it refers to first satellite in first plane, and epoch is defined by user's simulation environment\n- **Phasing factor**: Added explanatory text before the grammar semantics list\n- **Starlink example**: Added S:550:53:1584/72/22 for Starlink shell 1 to Table 1\n- **Typo fix**: \"foreseed\" \u2192 \"foreseen\"\n- **Grammar fix**: \"four orbital plane\" \u2192 \"four orbital planes\"\n- **Interval notation**: Changed [0, no-planes[ \u2192 [0, no-planes - 1] for consistency\n- **New co-author**: Added Juan A. Fraire to collaborate on link code and Flower constellation extensions",
