Abstract

   When considering a satellite constellation forming a non-terrestrial
   network, the characteristics of this constellation heavily influences
   the network topology it forms.  To improve the analysis of such non-
   terrestrial networks across various tools developed by the network
   community, this document proposes a notation to describe common
   constellation patterns.  In addition, this document may serve as an
   introduction to satellite constellations for IETF participants.

1.  Introduction

   The network topology of a satellite constellation is heavily
   influenced by its orbital characteristics.  Given the position of
   each satellite within the constellation, a network is formed by
   establishing links between neighbour satellites.  A common notation
   for the network community could improve the reproducibility of
   evaluations, measurements and simulations of satellite constellation
   networks.

   The true position of a satellite is often represented using a Two-
   Line Element set (TLE).  A TLE contains a number of fields describing
   the orbital elements at a given time of a given satellite.  Combined
   with a simplified perturbation model, the TLE can be used to predict
   the future position and velocity of the satellite relatively
   accurately.  However, when studying satellite constellations, TLEs
   may not be appropriate.  First, they assume each satellite has a
   known absolute position, which is derived from the launch time and
   parameters.  Second, they involve complex calculations given the
   chosen perturbation model which may not scale well to large-scale
   experiments.

   The approach of this document is based on the mission parameters of
   satellite constellation.  Based on these parameters, the expected
   position of each satellite within the constellation can then be
   computed.  While this approach does not capture the small
   discrepancies that can occur during the launch and operation of the
   satellites, we argue that it is sufficient in our context.

   The rest of this document is organised as follows.  Section 3
   introduces two variants of the Walker pattern for orbital shells.
   These are used to define many of the existing satellite
   constellations.  Section 4 defines the constellation code syntax
   using an ABNF grammar [RFC5234] and the code semantics.  Finally,
   Section 5 contains examples of existing constellations defined using
   the constellation code.

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

3.  Satellite constellations

   A constellation greatly improves the availability of a satellite
   service up to global or near-global coverage on Earth.  From the user
   perspective, a constellation offers more guarantees that a satellite
   can be reached at all times.  A constellation is composed of a set of
   orbital planes.  Typically, several satellites are present on an
   orbital plane.  They can be close together to perform formation
   flying or are equally spread within the plane.  Orbital planes are
   distributed in a complementary manner, i.e., they share some
   properties (e.g. altitude and inclination) but differ in others (e.g.
   longitude of ascending node).

   When all orbital planes of a constellation are circular orbits
   sharing the same altitude, they are said to constitute an orbital
   shell.  Constellations often consist of a single orbital shell but
   more complex deployments can have several shells.

   The rest of this section describes two common shells based on the
   Walker pattern.

3.1.  Walker constellations

   A Walker constellation consists of circular orbits sharing the same
   inclination.  Two variants of the Walker pattern exist:

   *  Walker Star, where orbits are distributed over 180 degrees around
      the equator.

   *  Walker Delta, where orbits are distributed over 360 degrees around
      the equator.

3.1.1.  Walker Star

   Figure 1 is an illustration of a Walker Star constellation
   considering the Earth equator as horizontal in the Figure.  The orbit
   trajectories are depicted by a dashed line, while satellites and
   their travel direction are indicated by arrow heads.

   The orbits of a Walker Star constellation often have an inclination
   close to 90 degrees with respect to the equator plane.  Given that
   they are distributed over 180 degrees around the equator plane, one
   half-sphere has satellites ascending from the south pole to the north
   pole while the other has them descending from north pole to south
   pole.  This is depicted on the two sides of Figure 1.  Over the south
   and north poles, all orbits are crossing paths before going over the
   other half-sphere.

   In a Walker Star constellation, a seam can be observed at the start
   and end of the orbit distribution around the equator plane.  That is
   the first orbit (resp. last orbit) is next to the last orbit (resp.
   first orbit) going in the opposite direction of the sphere.  It can
   be observed at the center of the Figure 1.  When communication
   between satellites of neighbour orbits is desired, a Walker Star
   pattern may not be suitable due to this effect.

3.1.2.  Walker Delta

   Figure 2 is an illustration of a Walker Delta constellation with two
   orbits.  The orbits of a Walker Delta constellation often have an
   inclination ranging from 45 to 65 degrees with respect to the equator
   plane.  Combined with the altitude, the inclination directly limits
   the latitude coverage of a constellation, while Walker Star
   constellations have a complete latitude coverage.

   Given that the orbits are distributed around the entire equator
   plane, there is no seam effect as in the Walker Star pattern.
   Instead, each orbit will cross paths twice with every other orbit.

4.  Constellation code

   Figure 3 defines the constellation code using an ABNF grammar
   [RFC5234].  The code can define a constellation with multiple shells.
   Each shell can follow a Walker Star or Walker Delta pattern.

   The code only considers circular orbits but future versions of this
   document could extend it to include the apogee, perigee and argument
   of the periapsis such that any elliptical orbit can be defined.

       constellation = shell [ "+" constellation ]
       shell = walker ":" altitude ":" inclination ":" plane-params
       shell =/ [ ":" mean-anomaly ]
       walker = "D" / "S"
       altitude = float
       inclination = float
       plane-params = no-sats "/" no-planes "/" phasing-factor
       no-sats = int
       no-planes = int
       phasing-factor = int
       mean-anomaly = float

       int = 1*DIGIT
       float = 1*DIGIT [ "." 1*DIGIT ]
       DIGIT = %x30-39

             Figure 3: ABNF Grammar for the constellation code

   In addition to the grammar presented above defining the syntax of the
   code, a number of requirements on the semantics of the code are
   listed below.

   *  The altitude is expressed in kilometres with reference to the
      Earth's surface.

   *  The inclination is expressed in degrees and MUST be within the
      range of [0, 90] degrees.

   *  The number of satellites must be evenly divisible by the number of
      planes.

   *  The phasing factor must be within [0, no-planes[.

   *  The mean anomaly is expressed in degrees and MUST be within the
      range of [0, 360] degrees.  It is optional and represents the
      current orbital position of the constellation.  When absent it is
      considered equal to zero.

5.  Examples of constellations codes

   This section provides some examples of how the constellation code can
   be used to define existing satellite constellations sourced from
   public information.  In some cases, when the phasing factor is not
   known, it is speculative.

6.  Security Considerations

   As the code specified in this document is foreseed as a user input
   into software that performs simulations, evaluations and analysis of
   satellite constellations, implementers SHOULD consider validation and
   sanitisation measures.

7.  IANA Considerations

   This document has no IANA actions.
